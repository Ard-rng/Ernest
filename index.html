            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>For ten days, I had the opportunity to immerse myself in the field of school journalism. Each day, I began my work at 7:00 AM and finished at 4:00 PM, following a structured routine that helped me gain valuable experience in media and publication.</p>

            <h2>Daily Routine</h2>
            <p>Every morning, our team started by gathering information on a specific topic. This involved researching, conducting interviews, and verifying facts to ensure accurate reporting. Once the necessary data was collected, we convened as a group to discuss our findings and plan the day's press conference. This step was crucial in determining the angles and themes of our articles.</p>

            <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
            <p>After the press conference, we proceeded with brainstorming sessions where ideas and insights were shared. As the designated layout artist, my responsibility was to arrange the newspaper pages, ensuring that the content aligned with the chosen topic and followed a coherent visual theme. My role required a keen eye for detail, as I needed to make sure that text, images, and other elements were well-balanced on each page.</p>

        <section id="experience">
            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>Aside from layout design, I was also assigned extra tasks, including editing the school newspaper. This involved enhancing images, adjusting their quality, and ensuring that they complemented the articles effectively. Through this process, I developed my skills in both graphic design and content management.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The entire work immersion experience followed a repetitive yet productive cycle. Each day, we refined our workflow and improved our efficiency, making sure that the publication met high standards. By the end of the ten-day program, I had successfully contributed to the completion of the school's newspaper, gaining invaluable hands-on experience in the field of journalism.</p>
            <p>Through this journey, I honed my ability to work under pressure, collaborate with a team, and manage time effectively. The experience has strengthened my appreciation for the dedication and effort required in producing quality journalistic content. It was a rewarding and educational experience that will undoubtedly benefit me in future endeavors.</p>
